# Growth

the net growth of the plants is modelled by...
- the [potential growth!](@ref pot_growth) that is multiplied by some [growth reducer functions](@ref reducer_functions) and a [belowground competition function](@ref below_competition), these processes are included in the main function [`Growth.growth!`](@ref)
- [Leaf senescence](@ref)
- [Agricultural defoliation](@ref)

## [Reducer functions](@id reducer_functions)
The growth of each plant species in each patch is dependent on... 
- ☀ the photosynthetically active radiation [`Growth.radiation_reduction`](@ref)
- the height of the plants in relation to the community weighted mean height [`Growth.height_influence!`](@ref)
- 🌡 the air temperature [`Growth.temperature_reduction`](@ref)
- 💧 the [soil water content](@ref water_stress)
- the [plant-available nutrients](@ref nut_stress)
- 📈 a seasonal effect, that is modelled by the accumulated degree days [`Growth.seasonal_reduction`](@ref)

Biomass is removed by...
- 🐄 [`Growth.grazing!`](@ref) and [`Growth.trampling!`](@ref)
- 🚜 [`Growth.mowing!`](@ref)
